                    <b>Covid Tracker India</b> is a statistical and tracking
                    project aims at tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in India.
                    This project gets the fresh data collected from multiple
                    sources and shows it in a meaningful way for better. It
                    shows the current and total data of confirmed, active,
                    recovered and death cases of Covid-19. The historical case
                    data of India is also drawn in a line graph for better
                    understanding of the impact. The graph can be switched
                    between all, last 3 months and last 1 month data. The state
                    wise data is also listed in a form of table which shows the
                    total and daily cases of covid-19 in a state or union
                    territory. It also shows the change in the number cases from
                    the day before.

                    I would like to thank the Covid19India Team for the valuable
                    data that is being used in this project. This project uses
                    the daily and historical case data exposed by{" "}

                    Team. This data is cleaned and then put together in a proper
                    format. The vaccine data is exposed by{" "}
                    <a href="https://disease.sh/" target="_blank">

                    via RAPS (Regulatory Affairs Professional Society). This
                    data shows the current status of each candidate vaccine
                    throughout the world.
